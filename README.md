# Memory Match ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¢
Ever wanted to train your memory in the ~~best~~ worst way possible? Play Memory Match!

The main purpose for making this game, besides wanting to train my memory <sub>hahahaha</sub>, was to practice DOM manipulation around the time I started learning JS. It was also a nice exercise in using SVGs.

I'm also a big fan of the UI which I intentionally designed to look as minimalistic as possible. My logic in doing so was that I felt it allowed it to look more timeless than if I were to throw a bunch of styles on it (and, frankly, it requires less effort).
